# Staff Member Tracking - Implementation Summary

## Purpose
Track which **staff member (admin/employee)** created sessions and processed payments, NOT customer names.

## Changes Made

### Backend Changes

#### 1. `/backend/app/api/v1/sessions.py`
**Session Creation:**
- âœ… Uses `current_user.username` (logged-in staff member)
- âœ… Records staff username in both `Session.user_name` and `Payment.user_name`
- âœ… Added logging: `Session created by staff: 'admin'`

**Session Extension:**
- âœ… Uses `current_user.username` for extension payments
- âœ… Tracks which staff member extended the session
- âœ… Added logging: `Session extended by staff: 'admin'`

#### 2. `/backend/app/schemas/session.py`
- âœ… Removed `user_name` from `SessionBase` (not needed from frontend)
- âœ… Added `user_name` to `SessionResponse` (for display)
- âœ… Added `station_name` to `SessionResponse` (for display)

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. `/dashboard/src/components/StartSessionModal.tsx`
- âœ… Removed customer name input field (not needed)
- âœ… Removed `user_name` from form state
- âœ… Removed `user_name` from API call
- âœ… Simplified form - only duration, payment method, amount, notes

#### 2. `/dashboard/src/lib/api.ts`
- âœ… Removed `user_name` parameter from session creation API call

#### 3. `/dashboard/src/components/SessionsList.tsx`
- âœ… Updated display: "Created by: admin" instead of "Walk-in"
- âœ… Shows staff member who created the session

## How It Works

### Session Creation Flow:
```
1. Staff member (admin) logs in
2. Clicks "Start Session" on a station
3. Selects duration, payment method, amount
4. Backend automatically captures:
   - current_user.username â†’ "admin"
   - current_user.id â†’ UUID
5. Saves to database:
   - sessions.user_name = "admin"
   - payments.user_name = "admin"
   - sessions.created_by = admin's UUID
```

### Session Extension Flow:
```
1. Staff member extends a session
2. Backend captures current_user.username
3. Creates new payment record with staff username
4. Tracks who processed the extension
```

## Database Schema

### Sessions Table:
- `user_name` (VARCHAR) - Staff member who created the session
- `station_name` (VARCHAR) - Station name for display
- `created_by` (UUID) - Staff member's user ID

### Payments Table:
- `user_name` (VARCHAR) - Staff member who processed the payment
- `station_id` (UUID) - Which station generated revenue

## Benefits

### 1. **Staff Accountability**
- Track which employee created each session
- Track which employee processed each payment
- Audit trail for all transactions

### 2. **Performance Tracking**
- See how many sessions each staff member creates
- Track revenue per staff member
- Identify top performers

### 3. **Security & Compliance**
- Full audit trail of who did what
- Can trace any transaction back to staff member
- Helps with dispute resolution

## Example Queries

### Sessions by Staff Member:
```sql
SELECT 
    user_name as staff_member,
    COUNT(*) as total_sessions,
    SUM(duration_minutes) as total_minutes
FROM sessions
GROUP BY user_name
ORDER BY total_sessions DESC;
```

### Payments by Staff Member:
```sql
SELECT 
    user_name as staff_member,
    COUNT(*) as total_payments,
    SUM(amount) as total_revenue
FROM payments
WHERE status = 'COMPLETED'
GROUP BY user_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

### Revenue per Station and Staff:
```sql
SELECT 
    s.name as station_name,
    p.user_name as staff_member,
    COUNT(p.id) as payment_count,
    SUM(p.amount) as total_revenue
FROM payments p
JOIN stations s ON p.station_id = s.id
WHERE p.status = 'COMPLETED'
GROUP BY s.name, p.user_name
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```

## Testing

### 1. Restart Backend:
```bash
cd /Users/admin/CascadeProjects/GameOps/backend
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 2. Refresh Dashboard:
- Hard refresh: `Cmd + Shift + R`

### 3. Create a Session:
- Login as "admin"
- Start a session
- Check logs: `Session created by staff: 'admin'`

### 4. Verify Database:
```bash
cd /Users/admin/CascadeProjects/GameOps/backend
python3 test_session_creation.py
```

Expected output:
```
ðŸ“Š Latest Session:
  User Name: 'admin' (type: str)
  âœ… user_name has value: 'admin'

ðŸ’° Latest Payment:
  User Name: 'admin' (type: str)
  âœ… user_name has value: 'admin'
```

## Display

### Session List:
- Shows: "Created by: admin"
- Shows station name
- Shows session status and time remaining

### Future Enhancements:
- Add staff performance dashboard
- Add revenue reports per staff member
- Add session count per staff member
- Add shift tracking
