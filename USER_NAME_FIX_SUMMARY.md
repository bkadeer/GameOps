# User Name Recording Fix - Summary

## Problem
Sessions and Payments tables were not recording the `user_name` field, showing NULL values in the database.

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **Frontend Issue** ✅ FIXED
- The `StartSessionModal` component was NOT collecting user name input
- No input field existed for users to enter their name
- The form data didn't include `user_name` field

### 2. **Backend Schema** ✅ FIXED  
- Added validator to sanitize `user_name` and convert empty strings to None
- Ensures clean data storage

### 3. **Backend API** ✅ FIXED
- Added proper handling to convert empty strings to NULL
- Added debug logging to track user_name values through the flow

## Changes Made

### Frontend (`/dashboard/src/components/StartSessionModal.tsx`)
1. ✅ Added `user_name: ''` to form state
2. ✅ Added "Customer Name (Optional)" input field in the UI
3. ✅ Sending `user_name` in the API call to backend
4. ✅ Resetting `user_name` after form submission

### Backend (`/backend/app/schemas/session.py`)
1. ✅ Added `@validator('user_name')` to sanitize input
2. ✅ Strips whitespace and converts empty strings to None

### Backend (`/backend/app/api/v1/sessions.py`)
1. ✅ Added debug logging to track user_name values
2. ✅ Proper handling of empty strings → None conversion
3. ✅ Both Payment and Session models receive the user_name

## How to Test

### 1. Restart Backend Server
```bash
cd /Users/admin/CascadeProjects/GameOps/backend
python3 -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### 2. Refresh Dashboard
Hard refresh the browser: `Cmd + Shift + R`

### 3. Create a Test Session
1. Click "Start Session" on any online station
2. **You will now see a "Customer Name (Optional)" field**
3. Enter a name like "John Doe"
4. Select duration and payment method
5. Click "Start Session"

### 4. Verify in Database
```sql
-- Check latest session
SELECT id, user_name, station_name, duration_minutes, created_at
FROM sessions
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;

-- Check latest payment
SELECT id, user_name, amount, payment_method, created_at
FROM payments
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### 5. Check Backend Logs
Look for these log messages:
```
Creating session with user_name: 'John Doe' (type: <class 'str'>)
Processed user_name: 'John Doe' (will be saved to DB)
```

## Expected Behavior

### With User Name:
- User enters "John Doe"
- Frontend sends: `user_name: "John Doe"`
- Backend receives: `user_name: "John Doe"`
- Database stores: `user_name: "John Doe"`

### Without User Name (Walk-in):
- User leaves field empty
- Frontend sends: `user_name: ""` or `undefined`
- Backend receives: `user_name: None` (after validation)
- Database stores: `user_name: NULL`
- UI displays: "Walk-in"

## Testing Script

Run this to check the latest records:
```bash
cd /Users/admin/CascadeProjects/GameOps/backend
python3 test_session_creation.py
```

## Notes

- **Old records** will still show NULL (they were created before this fix)
- **New records** created after restarting the backend will properly record user_name
- The field is optional - leaving it empty is valid for walk-in customers
- Empty strings are automatically converted to NULL for clean data
